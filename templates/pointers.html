{% block intro %}
The different types of pointers and references in the languages.

{% block description %}
<code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>auto_ptr</code> in C++ are both very similar to Rust's <code>Box</code>. <code>make_shared<T>()</code>
can also be used to generate shared pointers in C++.</p>
<p>
All three languages have a concept of a weak pointer or reference that does not impact reference counting or garbage
collection. Rust provides an atomic version that can be safely used across threads. Java provides a slightly stronger
type of reference <code>SoftReference</code>.
