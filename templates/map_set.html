{% block description %}
C++11 added brace-initialization to the language and greatly simplified the initialization of conainters. Rust does not
supporty any type of initialization for <code>HashMap</code> or <code>HashSet</code>. Java does not provide any type of
initialization for <code>Map</code>, but <code>Arrays.asList()</code> can be used for <code>Set</code>.
