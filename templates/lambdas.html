Lambdas and closures.
{% endblock %}

{% block description %}
Lambdas (and closures) were added to C++ in C++11 and to Java in Java 8. Rust has always had them.</p>
<p>In C++ you are required to specify the values that are captured by the lambda. In Java and Rust the compiler handles
capturing without specifying the values.
